# Brain Tumor Detection with Segmentation using U-Net and Color Overlay

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for brain tumor detection using the U-Net deep learning architecture with color overlay. The U-Net model is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks, and we have extended it to perform brain tumor segmentation on MRI images. The color overlay is applied to visualize the segmented tumor regions, making it easier to interpret the results.

## Introduction

Brain tumor detection and segmentation are critical tasks in medical image analysis. The U-Net architecture is widely used in various segmentation tasks due to its effectiveness and efficiency. This project focuses on using the U-Net model to segment brain tumors from MRI scans. Additionally, we apply a color overlay to highlight the segmented tumor regions, which improves the visual interpretation of the results.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies. Here's how you can do it:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection

## Usage

Before running any scripts, ensure that you have prepared your dataset as described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

## Model Training

To train the U-Net model on your dataset, you need to execute the Training Section in the `segmentation.ipynb`. You can customize the training parameters in the notebook, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
